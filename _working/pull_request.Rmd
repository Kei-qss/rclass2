Make sure bash works
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git
pwd
ls -al
```

# create directory and initialize repo
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git

rm -rf pull_request
mkdir pull_request

cd pull_request
git init

ls -al

echo "# R script to introduce and prctice pull requests" > pull_request.R
echo "library(tidyverse)" >> pull_request.R
echo "load(url('https://github.com/Rucla-ed/rclass2/raw/master/_data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.RData'))" >> pull_request.R
cat pull_request.R

git add pull_request.R
git commit -m "initial commit"
git status
```


CONNECT TO REMOTE
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request

git remote add repo_remote https://github.com/ozanj/pull_request.git

git remote -v
```


CONNECT LOCAL MASTER TO REMOTE MASTER
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request

git branch -a
git remote -v

git push --set-upstream repo_remote master
```


CREATE .gitignore
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request
echo "*Rproj*" > .gitignore
```


CREATE BRANCH "plot" FOR A NEW TASK WHERE YOU CREATE A PLOT
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request

git branch -a

git branch plot
git checkout plot
```


BEFORE CREATING PLOT IN RSTUDIO, CREATE DIRECTORY "plots" within pull_request repo
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request

rm -rf plots
mkdir plots
```


IN R STUDIO, MODIFY pull_request.R TO CREATE SOME PLOT

- code you added, in case you need to paste this in again
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#4. Perform the following data manipulations and save the resulting dataframe in an object to use later:
# create 0/1 dummy of whether high school received visit from CU Boulder
#Filter observations to keep only high schools that are located in the same state as the university
# Subset your dataframe to include the following variables: `school_type`, `ncessch`, `name`, `total_students`, `avgmedian_inc_2564`, `visits_by_[univ]`, `visited`

df_boulder <- df_school %>% 
  ## create 0/1 indicator of whether received a visit from CU boulder
  mutate(
    visited = if_else(visits_by_126614>=1 & is.na(visits_by_126614) ==0,1,0)
  ) %>% 
  ## Filter observations to keep only high schools that are located in the same state as the university
  filter(state_code == inst_126614) %>% 
  ## keep only selected variables
  select(school_type,ncessch,name,total_students,avgmedian_inc_2564,visits_by_126614,visited)

#5. Use the dataframe from the previous step to create a scatterplot of total enrollment by median household income and have different point colors based on whether the high school has been visited or not by the university.

getwd()
list.files()
#open png file  
png("plots/scatterplot_color.png")

#create plot
ggplot(data = df_boulder, mapping = aes(x = total_students, y = avgmedian_inc_2564, color = as.factor(visited))) + geom_point() +
  xlab("Total students") + ylab("Avg. median income") + scale_color_discrete(name = "Legend", labels = c("No visit", "Visits"))

#close file
dev.off()
```


IN BRANCH "plots" COMMIT CHANGES
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request

git add plots/
git add pull_request.R

git commit -m "added scatterplot of enrollment by income w/ color = visited"
```
PUSH CHANGES ON BRANCH "plots" to REMOTE REPO; FIRST YOU HAVE TO SET UPSTREAM REMOTE REPO "branch"
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/pull_request

git remote -v
git branch -av

git push --set-upstream repo_remote plot
#git push --set-upstream origin newbranch
```


TO DELETE A BRANCH IN REMOTE REPOS

- `git push origin --delete <branch>`
 
```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/git_branch

git branch -a

git push origin --delete newbranch

printf "\n\n"
git branch -a # you can delete remote branch even if the remote branch has commits that haven't been merged to master
```

```{bash}
cd ~/documents/learning_git/git_branch

git checkout master

git branch -d newbranch # error: `newbranch` not fully merged
```
