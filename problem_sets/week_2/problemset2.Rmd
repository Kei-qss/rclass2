# Part I: Command line & Git

1. Using your command line interface (CLI) (e.g. Git Bash, terminal), create a new folder called **lastname_ps2**. Be intentional about where you create this folder (hint: change directories to where you want to save this folder first). Then, change directory into the **lastname_ps2** folder. 

    Write the commands you used here (to create the folder and change directory):

    ```
    
    ```  

2. Turn **lastname_ps2** into a git repository and write the command you used here:

    ```
    
    ```

3. Use the `echo` command to output the text `"# YOUR NAME HERE"` and redirect it using `>` to a file called `problemset2.R` (hint: refer to example code in lecture). Write the command you used here:  

    ```
    
    ```

4. Check the status of your repository. Write the command you used here:

    ```
    
    ```

    According to the output, under which heading is `problemset2.R` listed under?
    
    ```
    
    ```
    
5. What is the git command to check what changes (i.e., differences) were made to `problemset2.R`?

    ```
    
    ```

    If you run this command now, do you see an output? Why or why not?
    
    ```
    
    ```
    
6. Add `problemset2.R` to the staging area and check the status. Write the commands you used here:

    ```

    According to the output, under which heading is `problemset2.R` listed under?
    
    ```
    
    ```
    
7. Use a git command to compute the hash ID for `problemset2.R`. Write the command you used here:

    ```
    
    ```

    What is the hash of the blob object?
    
    ```
    
    ```
    
8. Use a git command to get the content, type, and size of the blob object. Write the commands you used and the outputs you got here:

    ```
    
    ```

9. Commit the file and check the commit log. Write the commands you used here:

    ```
        
    ```

    According to the output, what is the hash of your commit?
    
    ```
    
    ```
    
10. Use a git command to get the content, type, and size of the commit object. Write the commands you used and the outputs you got here:
